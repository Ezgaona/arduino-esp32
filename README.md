# Fork of Arduino core for the ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3 and ESP32-C3 - Includes LWIP NAT (You are welcome!)

Feel free to use this library if you need LWIP with NAT enabled, for example to use ESP32 as a WIFI Repeater.

The original arduino-esp32 has a precompiled ESP-IDF libraries that doesn't have included the NAT characteristic. So I had to use the esp32-arduino-lib-builder tool to build with this characteristic on this version.
